			<span class="first-letter">H</span>ello! Welcome to my personal website. My name is Antonio, I am just a regular guy that loves life.
			I make websites for living. And travel the world whenever I can.
		<p>
			I sometimes work on my unfinished projects, I write about life, love, travel and, sometimes, about my job. I take also very bad photos, but I don’t use filters for it, and I don’t have a personal instagram.
		</p>
		<p>
		I also read a lot, sometimes I listen on audible or read on my kindle/ Ipad.
		If you expect to find a geek on this blog you might be disappointed. This is my personal space on the web, you can have a look at my CV or Github profile, but in this website I write about everything. Oh yes, I don’t really use much of social media, but I do have all accounts.
	</p>
	</p>
		I should say that I am a digital nomad, but I find the term quite limited in my opinion. What I do is that I work remotely and travel as much as I can.  At the moment I am based in the Canary Islands, but who knows what comes next :wink:
	</p>
	<p>
		I am a lot in to meditation and living a spiritual life. I love the nature and I believe is the greatest gift the man has ever had.
	</p>
	</p>
		I live my life in the glory of love. I love life, the World and the people that live in it.
	</p>
