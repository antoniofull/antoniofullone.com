				Hi, My name is Antonio and I am an italian living in Netherlands, I work as front end developer in Utrecht Delft. I was born in a little, beautiful and sunny town down to the south of Italy.
			</p>

			<p>
				I left Italy in 2008 and lived in Barcelona for 2 years, I'm a big fan of Barca and my little cat is called Messi :)	
			</p>

			<p>
			I like my job,I work with a group of smart and nice people, We are mootools guy, no Jquery :). I did a lot of work in the past, not only web designing, but I am also a 2000 bug survivor.

			I like food : italian, mexican, japanese and many others. I still dreaming to be a cook, I would like to own a restaurant on a island on the south pacific.

			I'm not so great at social network, I use to tweet but not so often anymore, I do have a facebook account and once a while I write a status. I also have g+ but honestly beside pure rss sharing and +1 to some posts, I do nothing. Instead I like foodspotting and Path. I don't use instagram (but I do have an old account) but I'm a pro flickr user. I manage a community of designers and developers here in the Netherlands, we use to organise talks and some workshop.
			</p>

			<p>
				I like learning new languages, actually I am trying with Dutch and Japanese. (no success 'till now :P).
				I love travelling, see new cities and meet new people. I'm not really so geek and I don't drink red bull, to be honest I don't even like it. Find me on twitter or via mail. :)	
			</p>

			<p>
				I'm not such a social person on the internet, but I am a lot in real life. :)
				So you can catch me on the various social network, but you will probably enjoy more to meet me face to face :D
