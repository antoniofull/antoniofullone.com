  <article class="post-content">
  <p>As expat, I am exposed to the risk of <strong>depression</strong> more than other people. The rate of depression among expat is <a href="http://www.utesexpatlounge.com/infographic-about-expat-life/">50% more than the general population</a>.  That’s a lot, but predictable. 
There are many extra factors for us that can increase the risk of being depressed: 
Missing the <strong>family</strong>, friends, adapt to a different culture, culture shock, learn new language, deal with bureaucracy, deal with racism, social life, weather and many many others.</p>

<p>I am not depressed. I am a solar and friendly person, I smile, have fun, at work and with my friends, with my family. I even manage a community on <a href="http://www.meetup.com/designers-developers/">meetup</a>.</p>

<p>My life has not been easy. I lost the most important person of my life, my <strong>dad</strong>, when I was 16. It happened the same day of my birthday. I woke up that morning excited and looking for him to receive his hugs and kisses, but the only thing that I remember was people crying around me, and him, laying on the bed, dead. It took me more than 4 years to go to the cemetery to visit him, I couldn’t. It was so hard.  </p>

<p>People kept telling me that his death on my birthday was a sign of the destiny, that I should take his place and role, but I couldn’t. He wasn’t only my father, he was my hero and I cannot be like him, you cannot be like your hero.</p>

<p>My <strong>mum</strong> took care of me and my 3 sisters, she worked hard, really hard. For her there were only those 4 children to look after, nothing else. I remember her tired at home, trying to not to cry while looking at the bills, “money are not enough, I need to find another job”, that’s what she was saying every time. I was learning how to make websites, trying to make a living of that, so she could stop working. </p>

<p>I always trusted the <strong>web</strong>, I knew it would land me a job one day, I knew that internet would become what is now, bigger and used by everyone. I started making websites when tables were still the must, and “<strong>webmasters</strong>” were those weird figures that people would connect to everything related to the word “pc”. But I eventually got there, I made a living with that. Last year my mum stopped to work, it was one of the best day of my life, I felt useful, I felt a little bit like him. </p>

<p>And then come my nephews, I don’t have a brother neither sons, so when my first nephew was born, it was for me like I had one. I’m also his godfather, and I am proud of him. Last spring he had meningitis, he arrived to the hospital in very critical conditions, death or brain damage are common in those cases.</p>

<p>It was a nightmare for me, away, alone. I was crying, punching walls, going mad. As soon as I could I took the first plane and went there. I saw this child in a bed. “He’s not my Sasi” - as I call him - I thought. This children was so different from my little Sasi, he could not even talk with me. It was hard, were hard months, for me my family, everyone around us. But he made it, he survived. </p>

<p>My <strong>sister</strong>, her mum, is also a very <strong>strong woman</strong>. Her husband had also health issues, he had a rare illness and needed a liver <strong>transplant</strong>. I stayed with her for more than one month in the hospital waiting for the transplant. She faced both issues with husband and son with an incredible strength, I don’t know where she takes it. I can only see how strong she is, how much patience and love she gives.</p>

<p>She reminded my <strong>mum</strong> when taking care of my dying father, they both never give up. They are strong women, women made strong by life. I wish I could be strong like them.</p>

<p>Instead I suffer from <em>sleep disorders</em> and <em>anxiety</em>, I almost never sleep well, I often wake up in the morning way too early and sometimes the “<strong>bitch</strong>”, as I call the anxiety, comes to visit me. Often when I am alone.I had tough moments and living abroad, alone, doesn’t help.</p>

<p>Despite all these problems I still smile, laugh, have fun with friends and nope, as I said, I am not depressed neither close to it. <strong>Anxiety</strong> is a common problem nowadays, it affects a large part of the population, our life style has changed. We live for work, career, <strong>money</strong>. We stress ourselves and anxiety it’s just a normal consequence of all this. I am fully aware of that and I keep living my life normally.</p>

<p>What I do when I have those moments when I “feel down”, I <strong>reach for help</strong>. I call someone in my family, or go to drink a beer with a good friend.</p>

<p>It’s like you are drowning in a <strong>river</strong>, it might be scary but if you just look around, if you just do a minimal effort, you will always find your way. There is always someone ready to give you his hand and help you out. <strong>You are never alone</strong>.
But if you let yourself go, then well .. the risk to be dragged in the big <strong>sea of depression</strong> is high, and then it’s very hard to come back, to find the mainland.</p>

<p>I am lucky, I have people that love me. My family is awesome, they are my <em>source of inspiration</em>.
But I know I am <em>lucky</em>, I know that for many others out there is not easy, that it’s not just about	 writing a blog post.I know it hurts, that is painful. But if you ask for help, if you just look around and ask for help, I am sure you will find someone willing to <strong>listen</strong> to you. </p>

  <p>Don’t let yourself go.</p>
