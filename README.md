# Welcome to my site.


## CSS 

I use _Sass_ for everything. The css is organized in modules which are build using sass and a grunt plugin inside the _assets_ folder.

The partials folder contains the variables and functions file. Also the utils file, which contains many common utilities I use on that site.

The Modules folder contains all the modules needed for the site, layout typography etc.

Finally the Lib just contains the external libraries that I use. For the moment just mine plus Susy ( I wonder how I did to live before met this awesome library).

## Javascript 

I used _Browserify_ and _Vanilla JS_. As you can see basically in this website Javascript is useless, but it's a good practice to keep your code modular.

I also learnt how to properly user Browserify with _Grunt_.

## HTML 

HTML 5 of course. I usually use _Emmet_ with _Textmate_, but since the update to Yosemite the plugin crashes everytime, so this time I wrote everything basically "by hands".

## Typography

Fonts used : 

- Skolar for the introduction text in the home page and for styling the first letter of each post.

- Freight text pro : for Headings

- Freight sans pro : for Text

- Cosmopolitan : for the "A" in the logo.

- Typekit is serving the fonts.

## Build 

Grunt, a very simple file. I would prefer to Gulp since it's faster, but the support and the ecosystem around Grunt is bigger and much more reliable, for the moment.

Especially because I used Sass Maps, which are not widely supported yet from all this "building tools".

## Design, blog, everything else

The first design happened during one of my insomniac night. Now it was time for a small refresh, I like keeping it simple so it reflects more myself :D

There are no comments, I have very few visits a day and I have no time to deal with comments, if I had time I would probably write more often (justifying the use of comments).

Share buttons are also not present, I guess everyone now knows how to share a post (thanks to Upworthy!!)

I am happy with feedbacks, so if you feel like to give me yours, I am happy to receive it. 

Typos, errors : I write really bad, I do the same in Italian which is my mother language, so please be kind when reminding me of errors on his site, I am aware of my writing style :D
