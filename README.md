# Personal Website of Antonio Fullone.

This is the source code for my website, is built with React JS and Jekyll.
Is a little bit of a work in progress and I am in the middle of redesigning the blog. (Check the Branch v5).

## CSS

I use CSS GRID and CSS CUSTOM PROPERTIES. I ditched Sass and other pre/post processors.

## Javascript

I use ReactJS and vanilla ES6.

## HTML Editors

I used Visual Studio Code and Mac Vim.

## Typography

Fonts are served by Typekit :

- Freight sans pro, mostly for for Headings.

- Tisa Pro for Text

## Build

Parcel is used for quick building with Yarn.
