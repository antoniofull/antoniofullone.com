Born in the beautiful and sunny [Calabria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calabria), Antonio is a designer & developer and — as he like to call himself— a wannabe cook. Eleven years ago, he left his home town and moved abroad. Since then he lived in different cities in Italy,  Spain and The Netherlands. 

He has travelled to several countries between Europe and North America and in the last two years he has been working remotely as a consultant, travelling to his favorite places while working with different companies to improve their UI’s and Websites.

His long time dream was to become a chef and own a restaurant. His hero and inspiration is [Massimo Bottura](https://osteriafrancescana.it). Today he is more than happy to work in the tech industry. Cooking remains one of his favorite hobbies and activities. He writes [code](), he likes to experiment with [CSS]() and [design]() things and [icons](). 

He writes his thoughts on a [journal](https://www.antoniofullone.com/blog) and he sends some [(re)tweets]() from time to time. He rarely uses [Facebook]() and does not have a personal Instagram account.

You can check his professional Bio (and photo) on [LinkedIn]() or download his [Resume](). He loves to travel, read books, watching series on Netflix and take amateur photos. He practices meditation and he’s interested in __philosophy__ and __Stoicism__. His favorite cities are __New York__ and __Malaga.__ 

His favorite quote is from Marcus Aurelius, author of [Meditations](), his favorite book. 

> A man's worth is no greater than his ambitions. 
— Marcus Aurelius		 	  

The most inspiring person he met was his father and he follows the principles he taught him: Respect, Honesty, Humility and Kindness.  He learned from his father another important life skill: listen more than you speak.
