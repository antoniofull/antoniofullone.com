export const about = `#Ciao nice to meet you! Born in the beautiful and always sunny Calabria, in Italy, Antonio isa designer & developer and — as he like to call himself— a wannabe cook. Eleven years ago, he left his home town and moved abroad. Since then he lived in different cities in Italy, Spain and The Netherlands. He has travelled to several countries between Europe and North America and in the last two years he has been working remotely as a consultant. Thanks to this he kept  travelling to his favorite places while working with different companies to improve their UI’s and Websites.
His long time dream was to become a chef  and own a restaurant. His hero and inspiration is [Massimo Bottura](https://osteriafrancescana.it). Today he is happy to work in the tech industry and considers himself  blessed by it. Cooking remains one of his favorite hobbies and activities. He writes code, he likes to experiment with CSS and design things and icons. 
He writes his thoughts on a journal and he sends some (re)tweets from time to time. You can also add him on Facebook, but it might take some time to respond because he uses it rarely.  He does not have a personal Instagram account, for the moment (see links section ;) ).
You can check his professional Bio (and photo) on his LinkedIn profile or download his Resume. He loves to travel, read books, watching series on Netflix and take photos of icons so he can draw them later. He practices daily meditation and he’s interested in philosophy and Stoicism. His favorite cities are New York and Malaga. 
His work and life philosophy are based on the KISS principle.  His favorite quote is from his favorite book and author, Marcus Aurelius. 
A man's worth is no greater than his ambitions. 
— Marcus Aurelius		 	  
The most inspiring person he met was his father and he follows the principles he taught him: Respect, Honesty, Humility and Kindness.  He learned from his father another important life skill: listen more than you speak.
