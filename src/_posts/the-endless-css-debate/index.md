Every day is a good day to ditch CSS and to talk (rage) about it on twitter. Yesterday was the day of the team at theguardian.com who published a lengthy post on why they are moving from their 62000 lines of SASS to a new and modern front end stack with React and css-in-js. This, as usual, sparked some "rage" tweets and the consequently discussions.

While I agree that sometimes the language of this type of discussions should be less angry and vulgar, I have to admit that I really like following these discussions, because often (if you are able go through the tweets and filter them) I find a lot of good technical insights about the pros and cons and the reason behind companies and teams to chose either one or other technology. So I won't go into technical details with this post, there are a lot of resources out there for this topic. Instead I'd like to look a bit at a different point of view for these type of discussions.

### It looks like a generational war

The word **"old guard"** is used quite a lot during these discussions, and it refers to those who are on the CSS side. Many of these people are the ones who fought for the web that we have today, that brought us web standards and this is why they care so much about the topic. On the other side, there is the new generation of developer who fell in love with Javascript, SPA and React-like libraries and, obviously, the css-in-js thing. It seems clear to me that the discussion goes from "css-in-js vs vanilla CSS" to "Old guard vs New generation". In the end it's less about the single tool and more about the philosophy on the web (or should I say the leadership?).

### In the social media era, your opinion matter more than your thing

Before the social media era, we had blogs (no, not Medium, I mean real blogs with your own content, url and cms). If you disagreed with a blog post you had 2 options:

1. Write a lenghty comment explaining why you disagree (and then keep going with comments)
2. Write a blog post about it and then send a pingback to the original post

Today if you disagree with an article you go on twitter and you let it know to your thousand of followers who, without even thinking about it, will retweet and make up their opinion based on yours. Of course this does not happen if I tweet "I like what the Guardian did with their front end" or "The guys at the guardian don't know how to write CSS", because I am far from being a popular person on the web and my social media activity is quite .... useless (I did not have my facebook yearly video because they did not have enough data for me ...).

But there are a lot of people who are very well respected, and that we call influencer or thinkfluencer. When I was reading this Guardian thread I read a lot of tweets from folks who were taking a side (either CSS or JS) but they did not even bother to read the post. The fact that your favorite designer/developer has such a strong opinion about a tools does not mean that you must follow, blindly, what they say. As developer we should be able to rationalize and make decision based on our evaluation (like the team at the guardian did), not on what people say on twitter. I notice this trend more and more on different social media, but I think that this is something acceptable for a 16 YO fan of Beyonce but not for a professional.
So make an **opinion on your own**, read the guardian article in full, look at the code, understand the different challenges they faced, look at the code again. Make an opinion for yourself, do not let numbers in social media influence you.

### I am Old Guard, but I do love React.

This blog is built on top of Gatsby, which is a static file generator based on ReactJs. Before I used wordpress then moved to Jekyll.
