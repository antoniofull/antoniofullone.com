Some years ago I decided to move from Wordpress to Jekyll. This year, for the new redesign, I decided to rebuild my website with React and Gatsby. The blog still uses Markdown and Gatsby will render it as normal html, same as Jekyll. Unlike Jekyll, I find Gatsby easier to use, and one of the big advantage, apart for the obvious React thing ..., is that is everyting set up for you.

Run, build, code transpiling, everything is ready out of the box, so in the end I could focus on the 2 main things, design and writing.

This is a list:

1. List item one
1. List item two
1. List item three
1. List item four

Second list items:

- Ordered list one
- Ordered list two
- Ordered list three
- Ordered list four

> This is a quoted text from some cool pal on the internet that it should go on a second line, now let's see if it breaks or not.

```Javascript
function code() {
return coffee;
}
```

```CSS
.i-am-cool {
    font-weight: 700;
}
```
