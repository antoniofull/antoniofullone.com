A while ago I decided to move from Wordpress to Jekyll. This year, for the new redesign, I decided to rebuild my website with React and Gatsby. The blog still uses Markdown and Gatsby will render it as normal html, same as Jekyll. Unlike Jekyll, I find Gatsby easier to use, and one of the big advantage, apart for the obvious React thing ..., is that is everyting set up for you.
