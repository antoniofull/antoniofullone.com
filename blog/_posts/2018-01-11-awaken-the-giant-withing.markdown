<span class="first-letter">T</span>his book is all about self development, to make your life better. At money, relationship, work.

[Tony Robbins](https://www.tonyrobbins.com) is a controversial character, some love him some hate it. But it is hard to remain indifferent to him.

Personally I like him, and I find his way of coaching sincere. I have read about his life, and I believe he truly tries to help people to make their life better.

Obviously he built an empire, but this does not mean he always did it for money. And is a good example of how following him can help us to ***improve our life***.

This is probably his best book, it starts with him telling you the story of how he realised that his life has changed, when flying to one of his events he found thousands of people waiting for him, like they do for a movie star.

The book is quite big, and I am not going to bore you with all the quotes and exercise he suggests. I believe that there are two main takes from this book:

> Raise your standards

This is the main mantra Tony tries to push in our mind. If we raise our standards we start to ask more to ourselves and we start to think that we deserve more. Everyone who wants to make his life better has to have internal self esteem, and needs to think high.

> We are what we think

We need to start thinking better, life better, eat better. Improving our life cannot happen if we have a low self esteem or we do not have respect for ourselves. Our thoughts shape our life and who we are.

Another take from the book is to **take immediate action**. And this is important, we can read hundreds of books, attend events, do whatever we want but without actions, everything will be useless.

I won't suggest to listen to the book. He speaks very fast and assimilating what he says can be hard. I prefer the kindle version or the classic version.
If you want to listen to him, is better just to look on **youtube**, you will find a lot of his speeches, talks, event. If you have [Netflix](https://www.netflix.com/title/80102204) you can also watch **I am not your Guru**, a very interesting take on his live events.

I am not a fan of his recents books, mostly because are focussed a lot on money rather than self-improvement, but this is just my personal opinion.

If you aim at improve your life, and need motivation to take action immediately, then I suggest you to read this book. As Tony says:

> Beliefs have the power to create and the power to destroy. Human beings have the awesome ability to take any experience of their lives and create a meaning that disempowers them or one that can literally save their lives.
