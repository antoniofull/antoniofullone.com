The benefits of meditation have been proved by science. While in countries like China or India this was discovered many, many years ago here in the west we have recently discovered how powerful meditation can be.

It does not matter if is mindfulness meditation or just meditation or just closing the eyes for few minutes. If you keep practicing this constantly the benefits you will get are immense. And really what just take is few minutes a day, no more.

So how do you meditate? Well, first thing to keep in mind is that it will not be easy, not at the beginning and that it will take some times to get use to it, but every time you just need to remember one thing: *Persistance*, persistance and costants are the key on succeed. At some point you will find yourself immerse in a world without toughts and the benefit for your mind will be incredible.

The first thing to do is to choose a time to meditate. I do meditate often during the day but my favourite time is in the early morning. This is because our mind is free of all the stress that might accumulate during the day. But obviously, you can choose any moment. You just need to have 5 minutes on your own, where no one can disturb you, turn off your phone and start practicing and remember, do not give up!

For a good practice of meditation I follow 3 simple steps. Concentration, Focus and let go.

## Concentration

First thing is to learn how to concentrate. This is similar to visualization (of which I will write in another post). So basically the idea is that for few minutes you need to concentrate your mind in only, and only, one thing. It can be an object, a thought or a goal in your life.
Just start concentrating on it and hold that thought for as long as you can. Build it visually in your mind and hold it, think only to this and to nothing else. You can start with simple object, like a table. First look at it for 30 seconds, then take 3 deep breaths and close your eyes.

Now start picturing in your mind the image of the table, hold this image for 30 seconds then .. start to give life to it. Picture the shadows, try to reproduce in your mind every single details of it. Do this exercise for at least 1 minute.

The next step is to move deeply on concentrating on it, focussing your mind 100% on the object. Imagine the wood, imagine the whole story of how this table have been built, from when the tree was cut, worked out until it reached the place where you bought it. This works similar to when you are reading a fictional book, you are so focussed on it that when reading you start creating in your mind all the scenery that you read. There are no images but still you can picture them clearly in your mind. This step is very important and it will take some time to learn it. I highly suggest to do it in the early morning, before starting your day.

## focus
Now it's time to start meditating and focussing. One of the simple technique is to focus on your breath or your belly. Just breath normally. every time your mind starts to wander, gently bring it back to your focus. The real exercise here is not to focus on the breath (or whatever you chose), but to gently bring your mind back to it. In the beginning I used to think to a hand, a big hand that gently takes my disturbing thought away and brings my mind to focus on my breath. Picturing in our mind is very important and effective. This is the most important part of meditating, and this is where many people fail. But they do not fail because they are not capable, instead they fail because they do not insist. Just do this for 2 minutes, every day. Not for one week and then stop. This is a practice that needs to be done every day, for long time. Until one day you, without even realising, you will find yourself immerse in your meditation, and your thoughts are gone. This is when the peace starts entering inside your mind. This is the moment when you don't want to stop.

## Let it go

Once you have started to meditate and cleaned your mind from thoughts, the next thing is just to ... let it go. Simply as that, on every moment, not only when you meditate, just let go all your negative thoughts. Replace them with positive ones. If you are meditating and your mind starts to wander again, maybe because you are worried, or something is troubling your mind, just let it go.

That's it! 3 simple steps to start meditating. The happiest man in the world, according to science, is a buddhist monk who spent his life meditating. The brain of people who meditate is more active than the normal.

Remember that to meditate you don't need to sit with your leg crossed, or say "HOOOMMM". Just sit down, relaxed, close your eyes, concentrate, focus and then let it go. You can do this even in bed, instead of thinking to the next day, instead of worry why not just relax your mind? :smile:
