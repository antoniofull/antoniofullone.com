<span class="first-letter">T</span>his is the first book I am going to review. And it is not a case. This is actually one of my top books, without any doubt. Sometimes it might seems hard to read, especially the english version.

Anyway this book is amazing and I enjoyed a lot reading it. So much wisdom expressed by a man who was imperator of one of the biggest empire in history, but despite this was so humble and grateful to the people who inspired him.

There are so many quotes I bring with me in my everyday life. Some example:

> You have power over your mind - not outside events. Realise this, and you will find strength

This quote is my favourite in absolute. The power of our life is completely in our mind, once we gain control of it, we become instoppable.

> When you arise in the morning think of what a privilege it is to be alive, to think, to enjoy, to love

What I really like in general is that this book it is not something written for the public, but it was just written by him for himself. Someone who led armies in war, conquered lands and still capable of sit down and reflect on the beauty of life.

If you feel bored to read it, you can buy the audio version on audible.

> It is not death that a man should fear, but he should fear never beginning to live
