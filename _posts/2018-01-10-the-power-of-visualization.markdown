One important concept and training we can do to improve our life is  **visualization**.
But what is visualization and why is so powerful? First let's start explaining the basic concepts.

### The mind and the subconscious mind

When we think, we are using our mind, obviously. Our mind speaks our language and is the primary source of our thoughts. However, we have a second mind, hidden, sleepy, that a lot of people never use. This is the subconscious mind. Think to both as the **system** 1 and **system** 2 from [thinking fast and slow by Daniel Kahneman](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0374533555/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=antoniofull-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=0374533555&linkId=76f5cbea802d0145ea01d8fe5d87d836). In his book he explain how our brain runs on 2 systems, one is automatic, uses instinct (like when turning on a light or removing the hand close to fire), the other one is more reflective. Most of the times we run on system 1. Same goes for us, most of the time we just use our mind.

While our mind speaks our language, the subconscious mind does not. The only way to speak to our subconscious mind is using images. Here it comes the visualization. If you are wondering if this is b****it, just know that this concept is backed by [science](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zESeeaFDVSw) and is not (just) a concept of meditation and spirituality.

I can make some easy example. Think to **Leo Messi** or **James Lebron**. They both grew up with different problems, health for one and environment for the second. Despite this, they always had in mind one think: *be the best* at what they do, what they loved to do. Soccer and basketball.

They thought every day on this, building in their mind these images of them playing for great teams, winning cups and being elected the best players in the world. They kept those images in their mind every day, this pushed them to go the extra mile, to keep training and motivated them. 'Till they reached their objective. The same goes for a body builder, if he wants to win a competition, he starts imagining himself winning this competition, he creates a clear vision of the moment he is elected the best body builder. These vision are what we call visualization. These images in our subconscious mind push our body and mind to go the extra mile, to give all the best we can to reach the objective.

When visualization is used in meditation, the effects are incredible. I always wanted to work remotely, have the freedom to live where I wanted and travel the world. I started thinking every day on it, dreaming of visiting New York or Cuba. Until, one day, I was in New York and then in Havana, while working remotely and living in the place I wanted to be.

Obviously this is not an easy task, imagine we want to win the lottery and we start thinking every day ... sorry it won't work. :smile:

But the point is that visualization is the engine of our subconscious mind, the force that drives us to reach our objective in life. **David D. Burns** in his book [The good mood](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0380810336/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=antoniofull-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=0380810336&linkId=8e8a09dca7a52d66aec13e2571ef402a) explain how he used visualization to quit smoking. He first listed all the reason and the advantages of quitting smoking, then every night before going to sleep, he would imagine himself in a place he loved, enjoying the advantages of not smoking. Like running on a beach, enjoying moments with his family.

So, how do we activate our subconscious mind and how we start using visualization right? Well .. the task is not easy, it takes time to learn how to do it. Visualization is not just about creating images in your mind, but is also about feelings. You need to learn how to clearly create the image in your mind, then you have to start feeling it. Think to the body builder example above:

*First you imagine you are at the competition, you feel the fatigue of your exhibition, then the pressure you have on you. You imagine all the crowd looking at you, you imagine the people that love you cheering up for you. You take this weight and feel the pain of the effort on lifting it.
You then imagine the moment they elect the winner, you hear in your mind the voice telling that is you, you see every one cheering, the colleagues shaking hands with you. You feel the moment of glory and victory inside you, like is happening for real. You enjoy this moment as much as you can, then once you open your eyes and you go to the gym, you will feel like you lived this experience for real, and here where the subconscious mind activate and helps you to get where you are dreaming.*

As said is not easy, it takes time, effort and focus to do it. But I can suggest you an easy way to start. Every morning, when your mind is fresh, before having breakfast, take 3 minutes to do this exercise.

Look at an object, let's say an apple. Look at it for about 20 seconds, try to memorise every detail of it. The shape, the shadows the colour the form.
Then, close your eyes and try to recreate the image in your mind. Focus only on this and when your mind start wandering, just gently bring it back to the apple. Once you have created the clear image in your mind, start giving it life. Try to move it, put it out of the table, take it in your hand, feel it in  your hands.

Do this for 3 minutes every day, you can use any object you want. It won't be easy at the beginning but once you start getting in to it, here is when the fun starts. As always, remember that ***persistence is the key*** and **working with your mind** is never easy. Our minds tends to be distracted by our daily life, by thoughts. This is why I suggest doing it in the early morning when your mind is free of the stress and worries of the day.

Visualization is a great tool to develop, or better to wake up, our subconscious mind. And once our subconscious mind is woken up, you will start seeing the benefits of it immediately.
