Tomorrow I am flying to Barcelona for a long weekend, I will meet some very nice friends there. We used to work together in Barcelona, back in 2010 /2011 and we had a very nice time. I was *leading* that team, so I am proud we built this *lovely friendship* which is lasting for years.

This is the list of the countries represented in this meeting : 

- Italy
- Netherlands
- Belgium
- Sweden
- Peru
- Finland
- Spain
- Argentina (probably)
  

I met these amazing people because I went to live and work abroad, and this is the best part of being an **expat**, something I never regret I did.
