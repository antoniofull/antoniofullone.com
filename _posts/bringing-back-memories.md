I’m back from my long weekend in [Barcelona](http://antoniofullone.com/expat-life/2014/11/05/not-just-about-work/). I had a fantastic time and met some of my old friend, some of them also former colleagues.

Is a different thing enjoy Barcelona as a “guiri” (tourist) than as when you live in. All the problems go away, people are happy and wherever you walk you can see and feel the “Barna smell”.

As nowadays there are strong discussions about a possible independence from Spain (right now they are voting for a possible referendum) I saw a lot of catalans flag, basically everywhere.

Las Ramblas looked much “cleaner” than the last time I was there. Less pushers and robbers or selling-whatsoever and more police than the usual. Also the Raval, the famous and “infamous” district beautiful district looked better, even if I still prefer to not go there in the night. 

I did then most guiri thing I could do, I went to the Camp Nou and took a selfie in the Stadium. It was fun. 

The Gotic and Born are always beautiful and full of life and lovely bars. 

Of course the port, the weather was fantastic and we could enjoy it the city.

One of the problem of Barcelona is that is an alcoholic city, I am not an hard drinker and I never been, I do like beers and taste it, but with Barcelona anyway you ends up drinking more than your usual but luckily I am only fan of beer, I don’t drink other types of alcohol, rarely wine.

Anyway everything was fantastic, it was great to meet my friends and enjoy this fantastic weekend.
Now I am back in Netherlands re-charged to restart, I needed this weekend to take a breath of fresh air. Tomorrow let’s go back to work.
